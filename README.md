# in-a-dungeon

A talk at the Home Office Data Science Conference, 15 March 2023.

Abstract:

> Ever done a technical training module and then immediately forgot what you learnt? Do you sometimes feel like you’re ticking boxes instead of actually developing your skills? Yeah, me too. Luckily, more active styles of learning are available. Maybe you can try working on a small, focused project where you can make mistakes and have fun. I’ve had success with this and, as a bonus, accidentally learnt more than I had planned to. I’ll give you an example of my experience and some ideas for how you might be able to do it yourself. The talk will involve a detour to an underground cave, but you won’t need any extra equipment.
